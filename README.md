# Final Year Project

This repository stores my final year project **Formalization of Auction Theory Using Lean and Mathlib**.

## Project Description

This project involves the formalization of key concepts and theorems in auction theory using the Lean proof assistant and Mathlib library. The focus is on providing formal proofs and definitions that align with the theoretical foundations of auction theory.
